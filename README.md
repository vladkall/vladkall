# Vladimir K
iOS Engineer • 15+ years building Apple platform products

## What I do
- Build high-performance iOS apps end-to-end: architecture, UI, networking, persistence, testing, release
- Modernize legacy codebases: modularization, SPM migration, dependency cleanup, performance tuning
- Ship reliable releases: CI/CD, fastlane automation, crash triage, observability, App Store readiness
- Lead and mentor: code reviews, technical direction, hiring loops, delivery discipline

## Core strengths
- **Apple platform depth:** UIKit-first pragmatism + SwiftUI where it fits, Auto Layout, animations, accessibility, localization, background execution, App Extensions, deep links, push notifications
- **SDK engineering (public + partner-facing):** API design that stays stable, versioning/deprecation strategy, XCFramework packaging, SPM distribution, binary size and symbol hygiene, backward compatibility, partner integration tooling and docs
- **Security & privacy (hands-on):** Keychain + secure storage patterns, Secure Enclave fundamentals, certificate pinning and trust evaluation, hardened auth flows (OAuth/OIDC), jailbreak/root detection tradeoffs, compliance-minded data handling (PII minimization, retention, encryption in transit/at rest)
- **Performance & reliability:** Instruments (Time Profiler, Allocations, Leaks), launch-time optimization, scrolling/jank elimination, memory tuning, crash triage/root-cause, offline-first behavior and resilience
- **Architecture at scale:** modularization, SPM-first dependency graphs, MVVM/Clean boundaries, feature flags/remote config, safe migrations without rewrites
- **LLM integration (production-grade):** Apple-native experiences + Anthropic workflows, streaming UX, tool/function calling, prompt/versioning strategy, caching and cost controls, safety/guardrails, eval/telemetry loops; on-device pipelines with **Core ML** where it makes sense
- **Quality systems:** XCTest/XCUITest, snapshot testing, deterministic tests, CI hardening, flaky-test control, contract tests (especially for SDKs)
- **Delivery & release discipline:** fastlane, code signing sanity, phased releases, App Store review readiness, observability, incident response, GitHub Actions/Bitrise/CircleCI pipelines
- **AppSec details:** TLS configuration, cryptography primitives usage, secure key management, audit readiness, security reviews and remediation loops


## Technical stack
**Mobile:** iOS (Swift/Obj-C), React Native  
**UI:** UIKit, SwiftUI, RN UI + native bridges  
**Concurrency:** async/await, Combine, GCD  
**Persistence:** Core Data, SQLite, Realm  
**Networking:** URLSession, REST, WebSockets  
**Tooling:** Xcode, Instruments, fastlane, CI/CD  
**Packaging:** SPM, CocoaPods, npm/yarn  
**Quality:** XCTest, XCUITest, Jest (RN), Detox (RN)
**AI/LLM:** Core ML, Apple-native integrations, Anthropic (streaming + tools)


## Current focus
- Swift Concurrency patterns that stay readable at scale
- SwiftUI where it fits, UIKit where it wins
- Faster builds, smaller binaries, simpler dependency graphs
